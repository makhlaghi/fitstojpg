FITStoJPG
=========

Convert a FITS image to a grayscale or CMYK JPEG image.





Description:
------------

The is the standard used by astronomers to archive and use
astronomical data. This package converts images saved in that format
into gray scale or CMYK (with only the black channel being active)
JPEG format images. The resolution of the output JPEG image is
identical to the input image. Some of the capabilities of FITStoJPG
can be listed as:

* Using greyscale and CMYK colorspaces.
* Convert all the possible extensions in a FITS image with one command.
* Specify a box in the FITS image instead of converting the whole image.
* Specify a flux range to emphasize on a special feature.
* Convert pixel value (useful in segmentation maps).
* Add inner and outer borders to the JPEG output.
* Set the quality of the JPEG image.
* Use logarithmic scale before saving as JPEG.
* Inverts the colors by default (great for including in a document),
  can be turned off.

See the manual (Chapter 1, Overview) for a complete explanation.





Requirements:
------------

FITStoJPG requires two packages to be installed on your
machine, installing them is easy and straightforward. 

- [IJG's libjpeg](http://www.ijg.org/), which should already be
  installed  on your system.
  
- [cfitsio](http://heasarc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fitsio.html) For
  reading and writing FITS files. I have explained [how to install
  `cfitsio` here](http://www.astr.tohoku.ac.jp/~akhlaghi/cfitsiowcslibinstall.html)





Installing:
-----------

To install FITStoJPG, after downloading or cloning it, all you have
to do is to run the standard configuring, compiling and installing
commands in the downloaded directory (`$` as user and `#` as root):

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    # make install

See `./INSTALL` for a standard review of the GNU build and install
methods.





Commandline options:
--------------------

Command line options are used to specify how FITStoJPG operates. To
get the full list of options and a short explanation of each, run
`fitstojpg --help` or `fitstojpg -?`.





Manual:
--------------

The full documentation of FITStoJPG is available in various formats.
The most readily available version is in the info format on your
command line. Simply run

    $ info fitstojpg

from anywhere on your command line and the full FITStoJPG manual will
be available to you. If you are not already familiar with how to
navigate, run `$ info info` and you will be up and going in about half
an hour and you will benefit in using all GNU programs, not just
FITStoJPG.





Comments and suggestions:
----------------------------------------

I hope FITStoJPG will be useful for you. If you find any problems in
this program please contact me so I can correct them. I would also be
very glad to hear any suggestions or comments you might have, thank
you.
